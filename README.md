# Shell Script Studies

This repository  is just my  ShellScript studies. Feel free to help me.

## Scripts

For now, the only script this repository have is just a ***`IsFirefoxRunning`***. This script checks if firefox is running. If not, prompts a dialog starting the process. Else,
it asks if the user wants to kill it. The kill command is code 15, a gentle kill(***SIGTERM***) if you want a brutal one, edit the code to 9 (***SIGKILL***).  

***Sorry, my english is a bit rusty. Feel free to help me with it too :)***
