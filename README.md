# Shell Script Studies

This project is just my  ShellScript studies. Feel free to help me 

## Scripts

For now, the only script this repositorie have is just a 'IsFirefoxRunning'. This script checks if firefox is running. If not, prompts a dialog starting the process. Else,
it asks if the user wants to kill it. The kill command is code 15, a gentle kill(SIGTERM) if you want a brutal one, edit the code to 9 (SIGKILL).
